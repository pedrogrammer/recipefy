# Commit rules

1. Capitalization and Punctuation: In the subject line, use all lowercase and do not end in punctuation. In the body, capitalize the first word and end in punctuation.
2. Mood: Use the imperative mood in the subject line. For example: Add visual reactions to the correct number.
3. Type of Commit: Specify the type of commit. See the following for additional information.
4. Length: The subject line should ideally be no longer than 50 characters, and the body should restrict to 72 characters.
5. Content: Be direct. Try to eliminate filler words and phrases in these sentences (examples: though, maybe, I think, kind of).

### Commit message convention:

[type][optional scope]: [description]

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

### The commit type can include the following:

-   feat – a new feature is introduced with the changes
-   fix – a bug fix has occurred
-   chore – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example, updating dependencies)
-   refactor – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-   docs – updates to documentation such as the README or other markdown files
-   style – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white space, missing semi-colons, and so on
-   test – including new or correcting previous tests
-   perf – performance improvements
-   ci – continuous integration-related
-   build – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
-   revert – reverts a previous commit
